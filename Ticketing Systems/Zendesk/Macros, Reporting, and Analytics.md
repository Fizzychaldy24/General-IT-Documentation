## Creating and Using Macros

### What Are Macros?

In Zendesk, **macros** are predefined templates that agents can apply to tickets to automate common responses or actions. They allow you to quickly provide consistent, accurate information to customers without manually typing out repetitive messages.

### Creating Macros

To create a macro in Zendesk:
1. Navigate to the **Admin** panel and select **Macros** under **Manage**.
2. Click **Add Macro** and provide a name and description for your macro.
3. Define the actions you want the macro to perform (e.g., send a specific email reply, change the ticket status, assign a ticket to an agent).
4. Save the macro.

You can create macros for:
- **Responding to common customer queries** (e.g., password reset instructions, account issues).
- **Updating ticket status** (e.g., mark a ticket as “pending” or “resolved”).
- **Assigning tickets** to specific agents or groups.
  
### Using Macros Effectively

- **Applying Macros**: Once a macro is created, agents can easily apply it to tickets by selecting the macro from the dropdown list when responding to a customer.
- **Customization**: Agents can modify macros before applying them to tailor responses as needed while still saving time.
- **Consistency**: Macros help maintain consistency in responses, ensuring customers receive the same quality of support across all interactions.

## Reporting and Analytics

### Overview of Zendesk Reports

Zendesk offers powerful reporting tools that enable you to track and analyze support performance. These tools provide insights into metrics such as ticket volume, response times, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.

Zendesk’s default reports include:
- **Ticket volume**: How many tickets were created, solved, or pending over a specific period.
- **First response time**: Average time between ticket creation and the first response from an agent.
- **Resolution time**: Time taken to resolve a ticket.

### Creating Custom Reports

1. Go to the **Reporting** section under **Explore** in the Zendesk Admin panel.
2. Select **New Report** to create a custom report.
3. Choose the data you want to report on, such as ticket volume, resolution time, agent performance, etc.
4. Use filters to refine the report by date, group, agent, or other criteria.
5. Save and name your custom report for easy access.

Zendesk allows you to create **dashboards** to track multiple metrics at once, offering a visual overview of team performance.

### Analyzing Performance and Trends

Once reports are created, it's essential to analyze the data to understand performance trends:
- **Agent Performance**: Track the number of tickets each agent handles, their average response and resolution times, and customer satisfaction ratings.
- **Ticket Trends**: Look for trends in ticket volume, types of issues reported, and peak times for ticket creation.
- **SLA Compliance**: Monitor whether your team is meeting SLA goals for response and resolution times.

Analyzing these trends helps you identify areas for improvement, optimize processes, and ensure you're meeting customer expectations.

### Customer Satisfaction Reports

Zendesk’s **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)** surveys are invaluable for measuring how satisfied customers are with your support. After tickets are marked as "solved," customers are often prompted to rate their experience.

- **Survey Responses**: Track positive, neutral, and negative survey responses.
- **CSAT Metrics**: Review CSAT scores over time to gauge the effectiveness of your support team.
- **Improvement Opportunities**: Low CSAT scores can highlight areas that need attention, such as response times or agent performance.
