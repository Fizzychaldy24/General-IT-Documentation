## Overview

In this section, you will learn how to set up a **knowledge base** within **Jira Service Management** to provide customers with self-service options. Additionally, we will cover troubleshooting strategies for common issues you might encounter with Jira Service Management, including problems with ticket creation and integrations.

## Knowledge Base Integration

### Setting Up the Knowledge Base

A **Knowledge Base** in **Jira Service Management** allows customers to find solutions to their issues without needing to submit a ticket. It helps reduce the volume of incoming tickets and improves customer satisfaction by enabling self-service.

To set up a Knowledge Base:

1. **Link to Jira Service Desk**: Jira Service Management uses **Confluence** as its knowledge base. You need to link your Jira Service Desk to Confluence.
   - Go to **Jira Service Management** > **Project Settings** > **Knowledge Base**.
   - Click **Link to Confluence** and follow the prompts to link the two applications.
2. **Create Knowledge Base Articles**: Once linked, create articles in Confluence. These articles can address common issues, solutions, and FAQs.
   - Navigate to **Confluence** and create a **space** for your knowledge base.
   - Populate the space with relevant articles that users can search for.

### Best Practices for Knowledge Management

- **Organize Knowledge Base Articles**: Ensure articles are categorized by topic, priority, and keywords. This makes it easier for customers to find relevant solutions.
- **Maintain Article Quality**: Regularly review and update articles to keep them accurate and relevant. Ensure the content is clear and concise.
- **User Feedback**: Enable feedback options on articles so that customers can rate the usefulness of the content. Use this feedback to improve the knowledge base.

### Using Knowledge Base for Self-Service

Once the knowledge base is set up, you can integrate it into your **Jira Service Management** portal. Customers can search the knowledge base directly from the portal to find answers to their questions.

- **Search Functionality**: Enable the search functionality on the portal so that users can quickly search for relevant articles based on their issues.
- **Automated Suggestions**: Configure Jira to automatically suggest knowledge base articles when customers create tickets. This encourages self-service and may prevent ticket creation for issues that can be resolved using articles.

## Troubleshooting Jira Service Management

### Common Issues and Solutions

Here are some common problems in **Jira Service Management** and solutions to help resolve them:

- **Issue: Customers Cannot Create Tickets**
  - **Solution**: Ensure that the customer portal is properly configured and that the users have the correct permissions to create tickets. Check if the project is visible to external customers and the issue types are correctly defined.

- **Issue: SLA Violations**
  - **Solution**: Verify that SLA definitions are correct, including the target response and resolution times. Check if business hour calendars and time zones are properly configured.

- **Issue: Notifications Not Sent**
  - **Solution**: Check the notification settings in Jira. Make sure the correct events are mapped to email notifications for the appropriate user groups.

### Troubleshooting Ticket Creation

Ticket creation problems are common and may stem from incorrect permissions or project configuration. Common troubleshooting steps include:

- **Verify Customer Permissions**: Check the customerâ€™s permission settings. They should have the "Create Issue" permission for the project.
- **Review Issue Type Configuration**: Ensure that the issue types are correctly configured and available for customers when they try to create tickets.
- **Portal Settings**: Verify that the customer portal settings allow users to submit tickets and that the forms are correctly set up.

### Troubleshooting Integrations

When integrating Jira Service Management with third-party tools (e.g., email, Slack, CRM systems), you may encounter issues with connectivity or data sync.

- **Issue: Integration Not Working**
  - **Solution**: Double-check the API keys, OAuth tokens, or integration credentials to ensure they are correctly entered. Test the connection and check for any error messages in the integration logs.
  
- **Issue: Missing Data in Integrated Tools**
  - **Solution**: Verify that the correct mappings are set up between Jira Service Management and the third-party tool. Check that data fields and records are properly synchronized.
  
- **Issue: Email Integration Issues**
  - **Solution**: For email-based integrations, ensure the email server settings (e.g., SMTP or IMAP configuration) are correct. Check the spam filters and email queues to make sure emails are being sent and received correctly.
