## Creating and Managing Tickets

### What is a Ticket?

A **ticket** is the central object for managing support requests, whether from internal teams or customers. It tracks the issue, its progress, and interactions, ensuring that every step is documented and accessible for the team.

### How to Create a Ticket

1. **Manual Creation**: Tickets can be created manually by agents or users. Typically, the process involves entering key information such as:
   - **Issue Type**: Bug, Service Request, Question, etc.
   - **Priority**: Low, Medium, High, or Urgent.
   - **Description**: A detailed explanation of the issue.
   - **Assignee**: The agent or team responsible for resolving the issue.

2. **Automatic Creation**: Tickets can be automatically generated by email, forms, or integrations with other tools (like Jira, Zendesk, or Freshservice). In this case, the system will capture the necessary information and generate the ticket.

### Managing Tickets

Once a ticket is created, it moves through various stages until it is resolved. Agents can:
- **Update the ticket**: Add notes, change statuses, reassign it.
- **Resolve or Close the ticket**: When the issue is addressed, tickets can be marked as resolved or closed.
- **Track and Follow Up**: Keep an eye on ongoing issues and ensure they are followed up within SLAs (Service Level Agreements).

## Ticket Workflows

### What are Ticket Workflows?

**Ticket workflows** define the steps and transitions that a ticket undergoes from creation to resolution. By setting up workflows, you can ensure that tickets are handled in a consistent, streamlined manner.

### Key Workflow Stages

1. **New**: A ticket is created and awaiting an initial review.
2. **In Progress**: The ticket is being worked on.
3. **On Hold**: The ticket is paused due to awaiting customer input or external factors.
4. **Resolved**: The issue has been fixed, but the ticket is awaiting final customer confirmation.
5. **Closed**: The ticket is completed, and no further action is required.

### How to Set Up Workflows

1. **Define Workflow Stages**: Determine the key stages through which tickets should pass. These could vary based on the type of ticket (e.g., Incident vs. Service Request).
2. **Set Transition Rules**: Define conditions for transitioning tickets from one stage to another. For example:
   - Tickets automatically move to **In Progress** when an agent is assigned.
   - Tickets transition to **Resolved** when the resolution is provided.
3. **Customize Workflow for Your Team**: Depending on your organization’s needs, you might add custom steps like approvals or quality checks before a ticket is marked as resolved.

## Automation Rules

### What are Automation Rules?

**Automation rules** allow you to set up triggers that automatically perform actions on tickets based on certain conditions. This reduces manual effort and ensures a smooth workflow, ensuring tickets are handled efficiently and consistently.

### Common Use Cases for Automation

1. **Ticket Assignment**: Automatically assign tickets to the appropriate agent or team based on issue type, priority, or other criteria.
   - Example: Assign all high-priority tickets to a specific team.
   
2. **Status Updates**: Automatically update the status of a ticket after certain actions, such as when a ticket moves from **On Hold** to **In Progress**.
   
3. **Notifications**: Set up rules to send notifications to relevant stakeholders. For example, notify the assignee when a new ticket is assigned to them or alert the customer when their ticket’s status changes.

4. **Escalations**: Automatically escalate tickets that are approaching their SLA breach or have been unresolved for too long.
   - Example: If a ticket remains unresolved for more than 3 days, it can be escalated to a manager.

### Setting Up Automation Rules

1. **Define Triggers**: These are the events that will cause the automation rule to be triggered. For example, a ticket being created, a status change, or a comment being added.
2. **Set Conditions**: Conditions specify which tickets should be affected by the rule. For example, apply this rule only to tickets of a certain priority level.
3. **Define Actions**: These are the steps that will be taken when the trigger and conditions are met, such as assigning a ticket, sending an email, or updating the ticket status.
