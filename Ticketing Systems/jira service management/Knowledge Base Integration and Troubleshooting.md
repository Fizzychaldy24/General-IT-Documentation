## Overview

This section covers the essential aspects of **Ticket Management and Workflows** in **Jira Service Management**. It provides guidance on creating and managing tickets, setting up workflows, automating ticket assignments, and sending notifications. These features help streamline your support processes, enhance agent productivity, and ensure timely issue resolution.

## Creating and Managing Tickets

### Creating a Ticket

Tickets in Jira Service Management can be created manually by agents or automatically through the customer portal, email, or integrations.

1. **Via Customer Portal**: Customers can submit tickets through the self-service portal, providing a description of the issue and relevant details.
2. **Via Email**: Tickets can be automatically generated from incoming emails if an email address is configured for the system.
3. **Via API/Integration**: Integrations with third-party tools or API calls can also create tickets automatically.

Once a ticket is created, agents can assign it, set priorities, and add comments.

### Managing and Updating Tickets

Ticket management involves keeping track of the issue status and making updates as progress is made.

- **Assigning Tickets**: Assign tickets manually or using automation rules based on issue type, priority, or agent availability.
- **Updating Ticket Status**: Modify ticket statuses to reflect progress, such as "In Progress", "Pending", or "Resolved".
- **Adding Comments**: Internal comments (for team collaboration) and customer-facing comments (to inform customers of updates) can be added.
- **Attachments**: Attach relevant documents, such as screenshots or logs, to help resolve the issue.

### Resolving and Closing Tickets

Once a solution is found:

- **Marking Resolved**: After resolving the issue, mark the ticket as "Resolved" and inform the customer.
- **Closing Tickets**: After the customer confirms the resolution, the ticket can be closed. If further issues arise, the ticket can be reopened.

## Ticket Workflows

### Understanding Workflows

A **workflow** is a visual representation of the stages a ticket goes through from creation to closure. Jira Service Management workflows allow you to define various **statuses** (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved) and **transitions** between these statuses (e.g., from "Open" to "In Progress").

- **Statuses** represent the current state of a ticket.
- **Transitions** define the movement from one status to another based on conditions.

Jira provides both predefined workflows and allows you to customize them.

### Configuring Workflow Transitions

To ensure smooth progress, you need to configure workflows that reflect your team's processes.

- **Create Transitions**: Define the paths tickets will follow, such as from "In Progress" to "Pending" or "Resolved."
- **Set Conditions and Validators**: Conditions ensure that certain criteria are met before a transition occurs, and validators ensure that required fields are filled before allowing a transition.

### Customizing Workflows

You can create **custom workflows** to match your organization's needs:

- **Design Custom Statuses**: Create custom statuses, such as "Awaiting Customer Feedback" or "Escalated," to reflect the state of tickets in your workflow.
- **Modify Transitions**: Add, remove, or adjust transitions to better fit your team’s needs.
- **Automate Transitions**: Automate status changes based on triggers, like auto-transitioning to "Resolved" after a set time or based on specific conditions.

## Automation Rules

### Setting Up Automation

Automation rules help reduce repetitive tasks, improve efficiency, and ensure consistent handling of tickets.

- **Create an Automation Rule**: Define conditions (e.g., when a new ticket is created) and actions (e.g., auto-assign the ticket to an agent).
- **Choose a Trigger**: Triggers initiate the automation rules, such as "Ticket Created" or "Priority Updated."
- **Define Actions**: Actions are what happen once a trigger condition is met, such as sending an email notification, adding a comment, or changing the ticket’s priority.

### Common Automation Use Cases

- **Auto-Assign Tickets**: Automatically assign tickets to the appropriate agent based on issue type, priority, or other criteria.
- **Escalation**: Automatically escalate tickets if they are not addressed within a certain time frame.
- **Send Notifications**: Automatically notify agents, customers, or other stakeholders when certain actions are performed, such as when a ticket is resolved or when a comment is added.
- **Ticket Closure**: Automatically close tickets after a set time, provided they are resolved but not manually closed by the agent.
