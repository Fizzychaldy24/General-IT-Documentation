## Troubleshooting Freshservice

### Common Issues

Freshservice users might face several issues related to ticket management, automation, and SLAs. Common problems include:

- **Ticket Creation Issues**: Problems in ticket creation may arise due to configuration errors or system glitches.
- **Automation Failures**: Automations that donâ€™t trigger properly or run at the wrong time.
- **SLA Violations**: Tickets breaching SLAs due to misconfigurations or delays in processing.

To diagnose and resolve issues:

1. **Check Configuration Settings**: Ensure that the settings for ticket creation, automations, and SLAs are correctly configured.
2. **Review System Logs**: Check logs for errors or issues that may prevent smooth operations.
3. **Validate User Permissions**: Ensure that users and agents have the necessary permissions to perform tasks related to tickets or automation.

### Resolving Ticket Assignment Problems

Ticket assignment problems can occur when tickets are not assigned to the right agent or team. To resolve these issues:

1. **Check the Automation Rules**: Review your automation settings for ticket assignment rules.
2. **Validate Routing Settings**: Ensure that tickets are routed correctly based on priority, department, or issue type.
3. **Verify Group Permissions**: Check that the appropriate agent groups have the required permissions to view and work on tickets.

If assignments are still failing, reach out to Freshservice support to help troubleshoot further.

### Handling SLA Violations

SLA violations may happen if response or resolution times exceed the agreed-upon limits. To handle SLA violations:

1. **Review SLA Policies**: Verify that the SLA policies are correctly defined with appropriate response and resolution times.
2. **Monitor SLA Compliance**: Regularly monitor SLA compliance via **reports** and **dashboards** to ensure timely actions.
3. **Set Up Escalations**: Configure escalations in SLA policies to trigger actions when SLAs are nearing breach. This could include notifying agents or escalating tickets to higher-level agents.
4. **Adjust Business Hours**: Ensure that your business hours are set accurately, as they impact SLA calculations.

If SLA violations persist, verify that your settings are correctly configured or consult the support team for assistance.
