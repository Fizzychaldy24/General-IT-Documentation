## Incident Management

### Creating and Managing Incidents

**Incidents** in Freshservice are created to address service disruptions or requests from users. To create an incident:

1. Go to the **Incident** tab in the Freshservice dashboard.
2. Click on **New Incident** to create a new ticket.
3. Fill in relevant details such as:
   - **Title**: A brief description of the incident.
   - **Priority**: Choose the urgency level (Low, Medium, High, or Critical).
   - **Description**: A detailed explanation of the incident or issue.
   - **Requester**: The user or department requesting assistance.
   - **Assignee**: Assign the incident to the appropriate agent or team.

Once created, incidents can be managed by:
- Updating the status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, or Closed).
- Adding comments and collaborating with team members.
- Assigning tasks or sub-tasks to relevant agents.

### Prioritizing Incidents

It is essential to prioritize incidents based on urgency and impact:
- **High Priority**: Service disruptions affecting a large number of users.
- **Medium Priority**: Issues affecting a smaller group or single user.
- **Low Priority**: Minor inconveniences that do not require immediate resolution.

Freshservice allows you to automate incident prioritization using **business rules** based on certain conditions such as issue type or department.

### Closing Incidents

Once the issue is resolved:
1. Change the incident status to **Resolved**.
2. Ensure that the requester confirms the solution.
3. If the requester confirms the resolution, set the status to **Closed**.

If the issue persists, you can reassign the incident or escalate it to a higher-level support team.

## Change Management

### Creating and Managing Change Requests

**Change Requests** are formal proposals to modify the IT infrastructure or systems. To create a change request in Freshservice:

1. Navigate to the **Change Management** section.
2. Click on **New Change Request**.
3. Provide the necessary details:
   - **Title**: A brief description of the change.
   - **Change Type**: Choose from categories like **Standard**, **Normal**, or **Emergency**.
   - **Description**: A detailed explanation of the change.
   - **Impact**: Identify which services or users will be affected.
   - **Assigned Team**: Select the team responsible for implementing the change.

Once created, the change request can be tracked through its approval and implementation process.

### Setting Up Change Calendars

Change calendars are used to schedule and plan changes in a way that minimizes disruption. To set up a change calendar:

1. Go to the **Change Management** tab in Freshservice.
2. Select **Change Calendar** from the options.
3. Add new entries to the calendar by specifying:
   - **Start and End Date**: Define the timeframe for the change.
   - **Change Type**: Select the type of change being scheduled (e.g., Emergency, Standard).
   - **Impact**: Specify which services or departments will be affected.
   - **Approval Status**: Set the change as **Approved** or **Pending**.

Freshservice allows you to visualize changes on the calendar, helping you plan and avoid conflicts with other scheduled tasks or events.

### Change Workflows

Workflows for changes define the steps and approvals required for implementing a change. Key stages in the workflow typically include:
- **Request for Change (RFC)**: Initiating the change request.
- **Assessment**: Review of the change impact and feasibility.
- **Approval**: Approval by change managers and stakeholders.
- **Implementation**: Actual implementation of the change.
- **Review**: Post-implementation review and validation.

You can automate this process by creating custom workflows in Freshservice to route change requests through each required stage and notify stakeholders accordingly.
